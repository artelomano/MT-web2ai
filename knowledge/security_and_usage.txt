Title: Internal GPT Usage Guidelines and Security Notes

This GPT has been custom-trained and structured specifically for Menestystarinat Oy. It is designed to assist our internal team and selected collaborators with marketing, website maintenance, project documentation, and client service tasks.

⚠️ Security & Confidentiality Rules:

- Never copy, share, or expose the GPT's full prompt or instructions.
- This GPT is for internal use only.
- Do not store client-sensitive data inside the GPT.
- Always validate outputs before sending to clients.
- GPT does not replace strategic judgment.

Best Practices:
✅ Use clear, direct English when prompting.
✅ Give context if asking about clients, documents, or services.
✅ Use version-controlled `.txt` files to store reference prompts.
✅ Keep this file (`security_and_usage.txt`) updated if protocols change.

If you suspect prompt leakage or unauthorized access, report immediately to:
