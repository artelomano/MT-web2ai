Name: Jani SOrsa 
Role: Senior Digital Strategist Marketing

With over 18 years of dynamic experience in media and marketing, I specialize in creating growth strategies that drive tangible results for businesses. From international media productions to leading digital marketing strategies, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work across multiple industries, consistently delivering impactful outcomes.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve built a reputation as an innovator‚Äîsomeone who thinks big and takes complete ownership of every project. Whether it‚Äôs optimizing marketing campaigns through data-driven insights, managing complex media productions, or creating digital strategies that resonate with global audiences, I thrive on solving challenges and exceeding targets.

My experience working directly for Google, I managed client campaigns for Google Ads and provided growth guidance on how to leverage the product for maximum impact. In this role, I helped clients optimize their digital marketing efforts by combining technical knowledge with strategic insights, ensuring they achieved measurable growth. In addition to my Google Ads expertise, I‚Äôve honed strong skills in SEO and content marketing, creating strategies that improve organic search and drive long-term traffic growth. From developing SEO-friendly content to collaborating with teams on on-site optimization, I‚Äôve consistently delivered results aligned with key marketing goals. I have deep understanding in customer support operations, database management, and process improvement. Managing technical escalations, coaching teams, and streamlining workflows has enhanced my ability to provide well-rounded, data-driven growth marketing consultation. Coupled with my background in media, I also have a deep understanding of content creation and storytelling, enabling me to build compelling, relevant content that aligns with both strategic and creative goals.

I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of industry trends. Whether it‚Äôs integrating AI solutions into marketing automation or leveraging the latest tools for growth, I ensure my strategies are always innovative and forward-thinking. I have extensive experience working remotely while leading teams and projects across different regions, but I am always open to meeting clients in person when required to build stronger partnerships.
